# 👋 Hey, I'm Ismail Hossain (smile-plzz)

Welcome to my GitHub – the digital graveyard where good ideas go to slowly rot into working code.  
I'm a CS grad turned MS student who spends most of his time convincing machines to do the heavy lifting so I don't have to. Most of my repos are **AI-driven experiments**, because nothing says "future-proof career" like outsourcing your creativity to neural networks.

If you're here expecting clean code and perfect documentation, lower your expectations faster than a crypto bro in bear market. But if you like projects that blend web dev with a splash of machine intelligence (and occasional existential bugs), you've come to the right chaotic corner of GitHub.

# 🚀 Live Project Showcase (The Ones That Actually Work)

Here's a cleaner, more Notion-style organized version of your project showcase section using a markdown table with emoji + clean columns.
You can replace the old "🔥 Live Project Showcase" part with this:

# 🧠 AI-Driven Shenanigans

Most of my recent repos are me poking at neural nets like they're magical black boxes that occasionally work:

- Brain tumor classification with EfficientNet & Grad-CAM (because why not play with medical imaging?)
- OCR-powered healthcare platforms (TensorFlow says your prescription is now digital, you're welcome)
- Various experiments with Gemini, LLMs, and whatever shiny new model dropped this week

If it's got "AI", "ML", or "neural" in the name, it's probably half-broken and twice as fun.

# 📬 Let's Connect (Or Not)

I'm more active on GitHub than in real life. Feel free to:
- Star something if it saves you 5 minutes
- Open an issue if it wastes 5 hours
- Fork and fix my crimes against clean code

Thanks for stopping by. May your bugs be reproducible and your coffee strong. ☕
